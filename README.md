# Hubitat

I left Hubitat and switched to Home Assistant, so I can no longer assist with any of these drivers.  I think most of them have an alternative implementation or replacement anyway.

Aeotec HDSS - Port of the Aetoec Heavy Duty Smart Switch Driver<br>
Join API - Continuation of @stephhack's Join API Driver<br>
Fortrezz MIMO2 - Port of the 2-port Fortrezz MIMO2 Controller.
